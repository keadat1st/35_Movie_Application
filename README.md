# Movie Application

## These are the requirements for the application:

* The system should be able to create, update, delete and display
    movies and actors.
* A user should be able to register and login to the system.
* A user would like to be able to add movies to his/her favourites
    list of movies and a history of which movies he/she has seen and
    when he/she has seen them.
* A user should be able to search for movies on relevant criteria eg.
    title, actor, or eg. production year after 1990.
* A user would like to see statistics of relevant things eg. when they
    saw which movie etc.
* When a user plays a movie the application should print out a list of
    actors and which role they played in the movie eg. Mel Gibson - Nick
    
    Marshall Helen Hunt - Darcy Maguire etc. 
    
### Software Design

1.  Identify Actors and Use Cases for the system, and write a Use Case
    Diagram
2.  Write the use cases in brief or casual format.
3.  Create System Sequence Diagrams based your central Use Cases
4.  Create a Noun List from your Use Cases.
5.  Create a Verb List from your Use Cases.
6.  Create a Domain Model with relations and multiplicity based on you
    Noun List.
7.  Create a Sequence Diagram (More information will come)
8.  Create a Class Diagram for the Movie Application.

	a. include associations, aggregation or composition Software
        construction You should develop the system based on the
        artifacts from software design.
